An example PySpark project.

The project uses pyenv and pytest.  It also demonstrates how to generate egg files.

Here is a [link](https://medium.com/@mrpowers/creating-a-pyspark-project-with-pytest-pyenv-and-egg-files-d2709eb1604c) to a blog post that explains how this application was built.

Forked from [MrPowers](https://github.com/MrPowers/gill) to run spark tests in a local Docker container named 'spark-custom' to avoid having to setup and maintain a local spark environment.  Using docker data science container from [here](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/all-spark-notebook)

how to setup the docker container is not in scope for this project.  However, you can see some of my examples [here](https://github.com/quagly/docker-data-science) specifically look at the spark-custom folder.

## How to run in container

This process executes in a already running local container.
See docker directory
